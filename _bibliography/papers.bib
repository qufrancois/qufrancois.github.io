	abstract = {Abstract: We consider the complex Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble, a family of random matrix models
	introduced by Girko that interpolates between the Ginibre Ensemble and the Gaussian
	Unitary Ensemble and such that its empirical spectral measure converges to the
	uniform measure on an ellipse. We show the convergence in law of its normalised
	characteristic polynomial outside of this ellipse. Our proof contains two main steps.
	We first show the tightness of the normalised characteristic polynomial using the link
	between the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and Hermite polynomials. This part relies on
	the uniform control of the Hermite kernel which is derived from the recent work of
	Akemann, Duits and Molag. In the second step, we identify the limiting object as the
	exponential of a Gaussian analytic function. The limit expression is derived from the
	convergence of traces of random matrices, based on an adaptation of techniques that
	were used to study fluctuations of Wigner and deterministic matrices by Male, Mingo,
	Péché and Speicher. This work answers the interpolation problem raised in the work
	of Bordenave, Chafaï and the second author of this paper for the integrable case of
	the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and is therefore a fist step towards the conjectured
	universality of this result.}}

	abstract = {Abstract: The convolution product of two conjugacy classes of the unitary group {$U_n$} is described by
	a probability distribution on the space of central measures. Relating this convolution to the quantum
	cohomology of Grassmannians and using recent results describing the structure constants of the latter,
	we give a manifestly positive formula for the density of the probability distribution for the product
	of generic conjugacy classes. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula
	is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this
	expression also provides a positive and explicit formula for the volume of {$SU_n$}-valued flat connections
	on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum
	of characters.}}

	lattice by edge labeled tiles and are known to compute the Schubert structure constants of
