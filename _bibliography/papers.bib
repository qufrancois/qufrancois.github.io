	abstract = {We consider the complex Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble, a family of random matrix models
	introduced by Girko that interpolates between the Ginibre Ensemble and the Gaussian
	Unitary Ensemble and such that its empirical spectral measure converges to the
	uniform measure on an ellipse. We show the convergence in law of its normalised
	characteristic polynomial outside of this ellipse. Our proof contains two main steps.
	We first show the tightness of the normalised characteristic polynomial using the link
	between the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and Hermite polynomials. This part relies on
	the uniform control of the Hermite kernel which is derived from the recent work of
	Akemann, Duits and Molag. In the second step, we identify the limiting object as the
	exponential of a Gaussian analytic function. The limit expression is derived from the
	convergence of traces of random matrices, based on an adaptation of techniques that
	were used to study fluctuations of Wigner and deterministic matrices by Male, Mingo,
	Péché and Speicher. This work answers the interpolation problem raised in the work
	of Bordenave, Chafaï and the second author of this paper for the integrable case of
	the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and is therefore a fist step towards the conjectured
	universality of this result.}}
